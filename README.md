By default, the pipeline work in local directory with 1) the paramter files of the parents and the clones completed, 2) all the bedGraphe files reported on files 1, 3) the files popx.txt completed. With default paramaters, the pipeline could be used with the following line:
Diversity_methylation_program

be careful, the order of the individual in parameter_clone.txt must be iddentical to parameter_parent.txt

to change the parameters, see the pdf files.

To test the pipeline with data of test, try Diversity_methylation_program --Pop_nb 2
